# LSTM-based-health-quality-predictor

• Trained different time series Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for Air, Water and Noise pollution parameters to predict the future pollution parameters of that place.

• Compared the results of Noise (univariate data) with ARIMA model.

• Used Random forest classifier to classify data into respective effects on health.
